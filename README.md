# Rotation-Effect--CSS
[](video/css.mp4)
I am displaying the use of the transform and rotation function of CSS.

When you hover the cursor on the box, it will move ahead and boomerang back , with color changes taking place all along. 
The video showing the effects have been uploaded in the repository. 
The code for the above effect has been uploaded in the repository as html_code for the html part of the code and for the css code, you may refer to the css_code.
